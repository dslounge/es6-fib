# ES6 Fibonacci playground

This project is a playground for fibonacci functions. It includes:

- `getNaiveFibonacci`: A naive recursive Fibonacci implementation
- `getFibonacci`: A memoized recursive Fibonacci implementation
- `getFibonacciPAndPairSum`: A memoized recursive Fibonacci implementation that keeps tracks of sums of even numbers in the sequence
- `getFibonacciEvenSumForLimit`: A function that searches for the sum of the even pairs in the fibonacci sequence whose values don't exceed a given limit.

## To run this project:

Install npm packages and run tests:

```
yarn
yarn test
```
